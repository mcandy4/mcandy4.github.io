        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            We are Jon and Mary Chang, owners of Frog's Cafe. We spent the last 5 years dreaming of a cafe that could provide a calm and serene space for our customers to relax and have fun with their family and friends. We believed that we
            could make our dream become a reality, and in January of 2020, Frog's Cafe was open.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to provide a safe space for the citizens of San Luis Obispo, while also providing yummy food and drinks. Located in the heart of downtown San Luis Obispo, our indoor-outdoor cafe has so much to offer. We are proud to
            serve the city of SLO through kindness and love, and we believe that spreading love is exactly what our world needs.
        </p>
        <p>Our passion for people and food is apparent in all aspects of Frog's Cafe. Our thoughtfulness and attention to detail is something we are proud to be exceptional at, and we can't wait for you to experience it firsthand.</p>
        <p>Thank you so much for being a part of our community.</p>
